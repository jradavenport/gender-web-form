# Gender in Astronomy Conferences Web Form

This is the web-based survey form used in several of the Gender in Astronomy Conferences studies. Feel free to use/modify for your needs. It is very lightweight, uses a simple php script, and built with bootstrap. It must be placed on a web server where your php script can modify the resulting .csv datafile!

Note: this web form was created by a complete amateur and hack: @jradavenport. Your mileage may vary.
