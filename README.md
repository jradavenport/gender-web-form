# Gender in Astronomy Conferences Web Form

This is the web-based survey form used in several of the [Gender in Astronomy Conferences](https://github.com/jradavenport/Gender-in-Astro) studies. Feel free to use/modify for your needs. It is very lightweight, uses a simple PHP script, and built with bootstrap. It must be placed on a web server where your PHP script can modify the resulting .csv datafile!
